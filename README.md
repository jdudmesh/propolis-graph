# Overview

Propolis is a radically open and decentralised peer to peer social network. It is fully open source and cannot be owned or controlled by any single entity or group.

It is based on a directed graph built on top of a peer-to-peer network. Metadata about people and posts is stored on the graph, content can be stored anywhere although IPFS is the preferred platform.

For more details see [the website](https://propolis.social).

This project is a labour of love. It is being developed as a personal project without an expectation of generating any revenue. Please consider sponsoring me.
